# Principium
What is this pack?
Principium is a kitchen sink style modpack for Minecraft 1.10.2. It showcases some of the new mods 1.10.2 has to offer like Mekanism v9, Psi, and Chisels & Bits, while still giving you the option to fall back to some of your known favorites like EnderIO, Tinkers' Construct, Forestry, and Botania.

We also added a bunch of in-game books to guide you through the experience and familiarize yourself with the new mods on the block.
